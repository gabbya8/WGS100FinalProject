          <h2 class="section-heading">Why Diversity Matters</h2>
          <p>One of the reasons why the Brown vs Board of Ed decision was so important is because it lead to the desegregation of American schools.  Though some states took a while to see the impact of that decision in the works, it continues to have an influence and raise awareness in the decades following 1954.  When black students began to integrate with white students, there were many concerns being raised about the kind of education provided by public school teachers.  One of the solutions to this is the employment of more black teachers, and we just saw how difficult that was in the 1930s and 1950s, post-Brown era.  This remained an issue in the conversation about education and began to gain national attention in the 1980s and early 2000s.  A study done by Montclair State University explored how having Black teachers in the classroom would help Black students to be successful academically and in their future.</p>

          <p>American schools pre and post Brown vs Board of Ed had predominantly white staff members.  This is still very true in the present day, although we have come a long way from that era.  In 1972, the US Department of Education collected demographic data for newly desegregated schools and the results were the following: 22% total enrolled students of color and 12% teachers of color.  A decade later, the statistics grew but only by a bit, with the stats for teachers of color going down by 2%.  It has always been difficult for black teachers and teachers of color to secure full time positions at public schools because of Jim Crow laws and a prejudicial school admissions board.  These statistics reflect the impact that era left on the education and teacher employment system.</p>

          <p>The main argument of the article, <i>Closing the Racial/Ethnic Gap Between Students of Color and Their Teachers: An Elusive Goal</i> is that there should be more teachers of color in public schools.  The authors give several reasons as to why this would benefit students of color, one of them being the shared or similar backgrounds of the teacher and students will provide a better learning experience.  This allows the teachers to use the cultural backgrounds of the students, which they understand, to create rewarding and relevant classroom experiences.  In the paper, the authors described how a Black teacher incorporated patterns found in African American churches, such as audience participation and emotionally charged discussions to engage her students in to the material.  The presence of a Black teacher also leaves room for culturally relevant topics for the students to learn and discuss which will be useful later in the students' lives.</p>

          <p>In Audre Lorde's <i>Age, Race, Class and Sex: Women Redefining Difference</i>, she commentates on the juxtaposition of the oppressed and the oppressors.  Lorde briefly addresses how this works in American society and how to survive, the oppressed learn the language and manners of the oppressed.  In turn, they are also expected to teach the oppressors what they've done wrong in society.  Interestingly, Lorde admits that she plays a part in this when she holds herself accountable for "educating teachers who dismiss her children's culture in school".  The oppressed teaches the oppressor and in return, they neglect what is important to the oppressed and in a way benefit from them.  This is very true when we look at the current state of education and educational opportunities for black students.  Often times in high schools and universities, one of the aspects of the school that is highlighted is diversity.  The student body may be diverse but the staff is not and I see this as a way of the oppressor benefitting from the oppressed.  The diverse stats may draw potential students to the school but in the classroom, their educational experience may not be culturally relevant to them.</p>
